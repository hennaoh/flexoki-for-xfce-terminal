# Flexoki Theme for xfce-terminal

This is as the title says, a theme for XFCE Terminal in the [Flexoki](stephango.com/flexoki) colour scheme. 

## Applying the Theme

- Download the variant you'd like to use
- Copy and paste the file(s) into `~/.local/share/xfce4/terminal/colorschemes`. Create the `colorschemes` directory if there isn't one already.
- Open xfce-terminal and go to *Edit*, then to *Preferences*.
- From there go to the *Colours* tab and go down to *Presets*. The Flexoki theme should now be in the dropdown list under Presets.

> [!Note] I used the lighter *300* colours for the dark theme, as opposed to the recommended *400*. You can change the colours if you wish to. They're all on the flexoki site linked above.
